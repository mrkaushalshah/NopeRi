# Noperi

A lightweight and Selenium-free Python API client for Naukri.com, designed to help you update your profile, upload your resume, search jobs, and apply to jobs (easy apply) programmatically.

---

**Status:** 🟢 Working (Last tested: April 2026)

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Login & session management (Bearer token) | ✅ Working |
| Resume upload (PDF) | ✅ Working |
| Profile update (headline, name, summary) | ✅ Working |
| Recommended jobs feed | ✅ Working |
| `nkparam` token harvester (Selenium utility) | ✅ Working |
| `nkparam` token generator (pure API, no Selenium) | ✅ Working |
| Job search (`/jobapi/v3/search`) | ✅ Working |
| One-click job apply | ✅ Working |
| OTP login/MFA | 🚧 Under development |
| Job questionnaire while applying| 🚧 Under development |

> **Updated on April 13 2026**  
> **No Selenium required** for core features.  
> The `nkparam` token is generated via API.  
> Selenium-based harvester is kept only as a backup utility.

> **No Selenium required** for features 1–4. The Selenium script is only needed as a helper to harvest fresh `nkparam` tokens for the search endpoint.

## ⚠️ IP & Hosting Advice

Naukri fingerprints IPs for every request. Many cloud providers trigger MFA or get blocked.

**Avoid:**
- Azure (all regions)
- GitHub Actions / CI
- Some Google Cloud regions
- Datacenter IP ranges

**Works:**
- AWS (EC2 with Elastic IP)
- Home broadband / personal IP (best)
- Mobile hotspot (testing)
- Residential proxy

**Note:**
- Sessions are IP-bound — changing IP will invalidate login
- Avoid GitHub Actions completely (IP pool is flagged)




## ⚙️ Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+

```bash
git https://github.com/Traverser25/NopeRi.git
cd Noperi
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
USERNAME=your_naukri_email@example.com
PASSWORD=your_naukri_password
```

---
## 🚀 Quick Start 
        you can simply run `main.py` also

        ```python
        from src.client.naukri_client import NaukriLoginClient
        from src.client.job_client import NaukriJobClient
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        import os
        import time

        load_dotenv()

        # 1. Login
        client = NaukriLoginClient(os.getenv("USERNAME"), os.getenv("PASSWORD"))
        client.login()

        # 2. Upload resume
        client.update_resume("path/to/your_resume.pdf")

        # 3. Update profile headline
        client.update_profile(headline="Backend Engineer | Python · Node.js · AWS")

        # 4. Update profile summary
        client.update_profile(summary="Experienced engineer with 2+ years building scalable APIs.")

        # 5. Job client
        jc = NaukriJobClient(client)

        # 6. Fetch recommended jobs
        jobs = jc.get_recommended_jobs()
        for job in jobs:
            print(job.title, "—", job.company)

        # 7. Search jobs
        jobs = jc.search_jobs(keyword="Node.js developer", location="Hyderabad", experience=2)

        # 8. Apply to jobs (easy apply)
        for job in jobs:
            mandatory = job.tags[:2] if job.tags else []
            optional  = job.tags[2:] if len(job.tags) > 2 else []

            try:
                result = jc.apply_job(
                    job,
                    mandatory_skills=mandatory,
                    optional_skills=optional,
                    source="recommended"
                )

                job_result = (result.get("jobs") or [{}])[0]

                # Skip jobs with questionnaire
                if job_result.get("questionnaire"):
                    print("Skipped (questionnaire required):", job.title)
                    continue

                print("Applied:", job.title)

            except Exception as e:
                print("Failed:", job.title, "|", e)

            time.sleep(2)

## 📖 API Reference

|---|---|
| `login()` | Authenticates and stores the Bearer token + session cookies |
| `update_resume(file)` | Uploads a PDF resume; accepts a file path (`str`) or a file-like object |
| `update_profile(headline, name, summary)` | Updates one or more profile fields (all arguments are optional) |
| `fetch_profile_id()` | Returns your Naukri profile ID (cached after first call) |
| `get_form_key2()` | Extracts the internal `formKey` from Naukri's JS bundle (cached) |

### `NaukriJobClient`

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_recommended_jobs()` | Returns a list of `Job` objects personalised to your profile |
| `search_jobs(keyword, location, page, experience, ...)` | Returns job results using the search endpoint |
| `apply_job(job)` | Applies to a job programmatically |

### `Job` model

```python
@dataclass
class Job:
    job_id:      str
    title:       str
    company:     str
    location:    str

## 🔑 The `nkparam` Problem (and Current Solution)

Naukri's job-search endpoint (`/jobapi/v3/search`) requires a request header called `nkparam`.  
This is not just a random token — it is essentially an **encrypted/signature key** generated using:
- current timestamp (time-based salt)
- session-related data
- page/context-specific parameters

The logic exists inside Naukri’s obfuscated JavaScript bundle, which makes it hard to reverse directly.

If `nkparam` is missing or invalid, the API returns `403 Forbidden`.

---

### ✅ Current Solution

We now generate `nkparam` directly via API logic (no browser required).

- Reverse-engineered structure of the token
- Recreated the encryption/signing flow
- Dynamically generates valid `nkparam` per request

This removes the dependency on Selenium and makes the system:
- faster
- more stable
- fully scriptable

---

### 🧰 Fallback (Optional)

A Selenium-based harvester is still available as a backup:

**`nk_param_getter.py`**
- Opens Chrome
- Captures network requests
- Extracts valid `nkparam`
- Stores in `nkPool.txt`

```bash
python nk_param_getter.py   # Optional fallback, Ctrl+C to stop
---

## 🤖 Using Recommended Jobs as an Agent Feed

`get_recommended_jobs()` returns a plain Python list of `Job` dataclasses, making it easy to pipe into any automation or AI agent:

```python
jobs = jc.get_recommended_jobs()

# Feed into an LLM agent, a Notion database, a Telegram bot, etc.
for job in jobs:
    payload = {
        "title":    job.title,
        "company":  job.company,
        "location": job.location,
        "skills":   job.tags,
        "url":      job.apply_link,
    }
    your_agent.process(payload)
```
